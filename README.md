# Aave-V2-DeFi-Wallet-Credit-Scoring
This project builds a DeFi wallet credit scoring model using Aave V2 transaction data. It applies feature engineering and KMeans clustering to assign a credit score (0â€“1000) per wallet. Higher scores reflect responsible behavior; lower scores indicate risky or exploitative patterns.
